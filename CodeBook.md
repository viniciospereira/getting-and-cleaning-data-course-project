## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. I was required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. I should also include a README.md in the repo with my scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.



##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
1. Load libraries.
2. Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
3. Read the subjects from files subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt.
4. Add a variable to represent the set (test/train) of the observations.
5. Add a variable to represent the lable of the activity in the observations loaded from file y_test.txt and y_train.txt.
6. Add the features into observations data sets loaded from files X_test.txt and X_train.txt.
7. Bind "observationsTest" and "observationTrain" data sets into a single data set.
8. Label variables with descriptive names.
9. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
10. Write the meanObservationsHAR data set into a TXT file.

###Cleaning of the data
The script downloads the raw data in the file getdata-projectfiles-UCI-HAR-Dataset.zip and stores it in the data folder. Then it reads the files subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt and stores their content in separated data frames. Then it adds one variable to the data frames to represent if the observation belongs to the testing set or to the training set. Then the script loads the content of the files y_test.txt and y_tain.txt and replaces the code of the activities for the label in the file activity_labels.txt, biding these activities to the existing data frames. Then it loads the content of the files X_test.txt and X_train.txt and labels the variables with the names in the file features.txt. After this, the script binds these variables to the two existing data frames. Then it binds the two data frames in one single one and labels the variable with more descriptive names. Finally, the script creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject and saves it into a text file called mean-observations-har.txt.

The variables selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAccelerometerXYZ and timeGyroscopeXYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAccelerometerXYZ and timeGravityAccelerometerXYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerometerJerkXYZ and timeBodyGyroscopeJerkXYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude, timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude, timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAccelerometerXYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkXYZ, frequencyBodyGyroscopeXYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

timeBodyAccelerometerXYZ
timeGravityAccelerometerXYZ
timeBodyAccelerometerJerkXYZ
timeBodyGyroscopeXYZ
timeBodyGyroscopeJerkXYZ
timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude
timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude
timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude

timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude
frequencyBodyAccelerometerXYZ
frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkXYZ
frequencyBodyGyroscopeXYZ
frequencyBodyAccelerometerMagnitude
frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude
frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude
frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
timeBodyAccelerometerMean
timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMean
timeBodyGyroscopeMean
timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMean

ONLY THE MEANS AND STANDARD DEVIATION (STD) VARIABLES WERE KEPT IN THIS DATA SET.
